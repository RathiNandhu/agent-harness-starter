# The one entry point for both workflows. It runs the two automatable stages — Harness and E2E — and
# stops. QA Verification is deliberately NOT automated here: it is an independent human (or an
# independent agent identity, never the one that authored the code) judging the evidence against the
# quoted acceptance criteria. A script that fills that stage in for itself has reintroduced exactly the
# self-confirmation problem this whole kit exists to prevent.
#
# USAGE
#   run-qa-workflow.sh ticket <TICKET-ID>              stages 3-4 of core/jira-workflow-contract.md
#   run-qa-workflow.sh regression [scope-id]            stages 1-2 of core/regression-workflow-contract.md
#   run-qa-workflow.sh verify <result.json> <PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED> <reviewer> [notes]
#                                                        records stage 5/3 (QA Verification) and computes finalResult
#
# CONFIG: reads <repo-root>/qa.config.yaml — flat `key: value` lines only, see qa.config.schema.json.
# This is parsed with a plain bash loop, not a YAML library, for the same reason the harness ships with
# zero third-party dependencies: a workflow that cannot run because a package was not installed is
# indistinguishable, from the outside, from a workflow that ran and found nothing wrong.
