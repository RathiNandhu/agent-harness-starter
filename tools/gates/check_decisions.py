"""Validate the decision register — the questions the team cannot answer without an owner.

WHAT A DECISION REGISTER IS, AND THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES.

When someone building a feature hits a question the design does not settle, they have two options.
They can pick the sensible-looking answer and move on, or they can stop and get a ruling. Almost
everyone picks the first, because it is faster and the choice usually looks obvious.

The cost arrives later. **Once a guess is in the code it is indistinguishable from a decision.** Six
months on, nobody can tell which lines reflect a deliberate choice and which reflect somebody's
Tuesday afternoon. Changing them is frightening, because you cannot tell what you might be undoing.

The register keeps those two categories apart. A blocked question becomes a numbered row with the
options written down, and work routes around it instead of through it.

This matters far more with AI agents than with people. An agent will always produce a confident
answer — that is what it is for — so "stop and ask" has to be a mechanical rule with a gate behind
it, not an instinct you hope it has.

WHAT THIS GATE ENFORCES, and the reason for each.

  1. SCHEMA — every row carries every required field. A half-written row is a decision nobody can
     act on, which is the same as no row.
  2. UNIQUE, PERMANENT IDs — a number is never reused and never renumbered. Renumbering on closure
     dangles every citation of the old number, and frees the number for a different question.
  3. AN ISSUE LINK ON EVERY OPEN ROW — **this is the delivery mechanism.** A row in a file nobody
     opens has told nobody anything. The tracker's assignment notification is what actually reaches a
     human. This is the field most often missing, and the one whose absence is most expensive.
  4. CANDIDATE ANSWERS — the options, labelled. A question is not an answer; a decider must be able
     to see what they are choosing between without reconstructing it.
  5. WHAT DIFFERS IN THE CODE — **the entry condition, and the cleverest rule here.** Name what
     would be physically different under each option. If you cannot, this is a TASK, not a decision,
     and it does not belong in a decision register. Without this test the register slowly fills with
     to-do items and stops being read.
  6. A CLOSED ROW CITES ITS RULING — a row closes by pointing at a durable, findable decision.
     "We agreed in a meeting" cannot close a row, because a later reader cannot look it up.
  7. NO DANGLING CITATIONS — if a document anywhere cites a decision id, a row with that id must
     exist. A decision cited but never recorded is the precise failure the register exists to stop.
     Note the convention this forces, which caught a bug in this very file: prose that DISCUSSES an
     id must write it unnumbered (`DEC-<n>`), because a real number in a comment is a citation the
     scan will rightly demand a row for.

TAILOR, DO NOT WEAKEN. `ID_PREFIX`, the `REQUIRED_FIELDS_*` lists and `STATUSES` are meant to be edited
to fit your project. Removing a check because a row fails it is not tailoring — it is deleting the finding.

EXIT CODES: 0 verified · 1 violated · 2 could not run. See harness.py; 2 is not a pass.
