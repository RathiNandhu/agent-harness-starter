"""If there is code to mutate, mutation testing must be obtainable for it.

WHY THIS GATE IS UNUSUAL, AND WHY IT IS THE MOST USEFUL ONE IN THE KIT.

Most gates check that something is right. This one checks that a **measurement is possible** — and it
exists because of a specific, very common way a quality plan quietly dies.

The pattern goes like this. Someone writes "we should add mutation testing" in a document. It becomes
an item on a list. The list is reviewed occasionally and the item is still true, so it stays. Nothing
ever fails, so nothing ever forces the issue. **A to-do is not a control.** Two years later the
document still says mutation testing is the coverage metric and no package has ever been measured.

This gate is the difference. It distinguishes two states that otherwise both look fine:

    NOT APPLICABLE   There is no source, so there is nothing to measure. Passes — **and states the
                     trigger**, because "not applicable" stops being true silently the first time
                     somebody adds a source file.

    UNOBTAINABLE     There IS source, and the metric cannot be produced for it. **Fails.**

The second is the obvious value. The first is the one that matters more in practice, because that is
the transition nobody is watching for.

WHY MUTATION TESTING SPECIFICALLY, rather than line coverage: coverage measures *execution*, mutation
measures *verification*. A test that calls a function and asserts nothing scores full coverage and
kills no mutants. When an AI agent writes both the code and the tests, assertion-free tests are the
default failure mode — so coverage is precisely the wrong thing to gate on, and mutation is precisely
the right one.

TAILOR: `SOURCE_EXTENSIONS`, `TEST_SUFFIXES`, `EXCLUDE_PARTS` and `CONFIG_CANDIDATES` are meant to be
edited for your language and layout. The shape of the check does not change.

Note `EXCLUDE_PARTS` skips `examples`, `fixtures` and `testdata` by default, on the assumption they
hold sample data rather than shipped code. If your project keeps real source in one of those, remove
it from the set — otherwise you get the silent pass this gate exists to prevent.

EXIT CODES: 0 not applicable, or source present and mutation tooling configured · 1 source present and
no mutation config found. This gate reaches its verdict from configuration PRESENCE — it does not
inspect whether the config actually reaches the source, because that is language- and tool-specific,
so it never emits 2 or 3. See harness.py; 2 and 3 are never a pass.
