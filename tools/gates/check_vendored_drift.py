"""Shared files copied in from an upstream repository still match what was copied.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES.

Once you have more than one repository, some things want to be shared — review agent definitions,
lint configs, CI workflows, gates like these. The clean answer is to publish them as a versioned
package and have each repo consume it. Teams rarely start there, because publishing infrastructure is
work and copying a file takes seconds.

So the files get copied. And then **the copies rot silently.** Someone improves the original; the
copies keep the old behaviour; nothing anywhere reports it. The failure is quiet, and it lands in
exactly the files you would least like to be stale — the ones that decide how code gets reviewed.

Measured on the project this kit came from: an upstream change added four lines to a shared review
skill, and **three downstream copies went stale the same day**, with nothing noticing.

This gate does not fix that. It makes it **visible**, which is what you can actually have before the
publishing question is settled.

WHAT IT CATCHES, AND THE HALF IT CANNOT — read both, because the limit matters.

  CATCHES — a shared file edited HERE instead of upstream. That is the failure this repo can cause,
  and the one that quietly forks a shared asset: the next person to compare finds two versions and no
  record of which is authoritative.

  CANNOT CATCH — upstream moving ahead. Detecting that needs this repo to read upstream's tree, which
  needs network access and a credential. And the upstream repo usually cannot push the check either,
  because a well-structured upstream does not depend on its consumers.

  **So a pass means "unchanged since copied". It does NOT mean "up to date."** The gate says so in its
  own output, because a green check that gets over-read is worse than no check.

TWO CLASSES OF FILE, because they admit different checks:

  verbatim  — byte-identical to upstream. Checked by hash. Kept byte-identical ON PURPOSE rather than
              locally "improved": a file adapted for local taste is a file nobody can diff, and it
              forks quietly. Put local context in a document, never in the file.
  templated — differs from upstream by a known rule (a repo name, an org slug). A hash is meaningless,
              so instead the check confirms the substitution is COMPLETE — no upstream marker survives.
              A half-substituted config points tooling at the wrong repository, which is worse than an
              obviously missing one because it looks configured.

SETUP: create `tools/gates/vendored.json` — see `examples/vendored.json` in this kit. If the file is
absent this gate reports NOT APPLICABLE and passes, because a single-repo project has nothing to
share and should not be nagged.

A malformed manifest is a could-not-run, not a crash and not a pass. The structure is validated up
front (`manifest_structure_error`), so a manifest that is the wrong shape — top level not an object, a
`verbatim`/`templated` block not a map, a hash that is not a string, a templated value that is not an
object — reaches ONE clean exit-2 verdict instead of raising partway through and exiting 1, which would
read as a real drift. Annotation keys are tolerated only at the top level; inside the maps every key is
a real vendored path and is checked as one.

EXIT CODES: 0 verified · 1 drifted or missing · 2 could not run.
